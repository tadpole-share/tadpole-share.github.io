## SHaring TADPOLE’s Algorithms for Reuse and Evaluation

This website is part of the [TADPOLE-SHARE project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/tadpole-share) awarded to [Esther Bron](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/the-winner-of-the-young-escientist-award-2018-is) (Erasmus MC) by the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). This project builds upon the [TADPOLE challenge](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/) and provides an example of how algorithms for predicting Alzheimer’s disease can be made available for futher development and re-use. We provide tutorials and example code for the EMC-EB algorithm that participated in the TADPOLE challenge.
