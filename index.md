### Workshop program
* Opening by Liam Connor (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
* Talk by Adriënne Mendrik (Netherlands eScience Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) “Introduction to Challenges and the EYRA Benchmark Platform” [(slides are here)](https://github.com/EYRA-Benchmark/FRBSearchSoft/blob/master/FRB%20Benchmark%20Workshop%20-%20Adrienne%20Mendrik%20(eScience%20center)%20.pdf)
* Liam Connor (University of Amsterdam) “Introduction to the FRB Detection Benchmark Initiative”
* Coffee Break
* Brainstorm on the FRB Detection Benchmark:
  * Input: Filterbank (.fil) or other
  * Output: Text file
    * What should be in there? SN, dispersion, pulse width, arrival time, scattering measure, ...
    * How should it be structured?
  * Benchmark data: 
    * Different telescopes (what data can people contribute? How large?)
    * Simulation of the FRBs
  * What metrics should be used to rank the algorithms?
* Lunch Break
* Break-out sessions
  * Dockerize software
  * Design Benchmark (data, simulations, metrics, etc)
* Closing

### Potential deliverables
* Global benchmark design and an overview of existing data
* Some dockerized software packages
