subtitle: A platform for sharing prediction algorithms for Alzheimer’s disease.
---

Dementia is a complex syndrome with Alzheimer’s disease as its most common form. Currently, no curative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease is available. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an accurate prediction of the disease progression in the early stage of the disease in individual patients. This would enable clinical trials to include the patients in which the treatment is expected to be most effective.

In this project, we plan to build a platform for sharing prediction algorithms for Alzheimer’s disease with the scientific community. The platform will enable further development and improvement of these prediction methods as well as their further validation on other datasets of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.The projects builds onthe TADPOLE challenge (https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/), in which 62 prediction models - developed by 34 international research teams - were objectively compared [Marinescu et al., 2017].
